# Sports and health data analysis via Web Scraping & API REST

📝 Description:
This project implements a dual approach of data extraction from a REST API and web scraping, in order to collect, analyze and present relevant information in two distinct fields: sports and global health.

🏀 REST API - nba_api: Use of the nba_api library to access statistical data on NBA players (scores, performances, teams). The retrieved data is filtered and analyzed with pandas.

🌍 Web Scraping - worldometers.info: Automated extraction of COVID-19 data tables on worldometers.info using BeautifulSoup and the html.parser.

🔧 Processing and analysis: Cleaning, transformation and visualization of data to derive key indicators.

💻 Technologies used: Python, nba_api, Requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, VS Code.

This project illustrates my ability to combine various data sources (API and web) to produce usable and reliable analyses.
